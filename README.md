# simple-neural-network
Simple NN is a neural network implemented in C language, which includes a multilayer perceptron and a convolutional network. It is a digital handwriting recognition program that utilizes the MNIST dataset for training the neural network model.

## compile and run
### MNIST file
Running requires the MNIST data set, which can be downloaded from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ and store the downloaded data in the ./data directory.Please view data/readme.txt
